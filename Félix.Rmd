For this work, I decided to do the correlation between the content duration and the share count. This proves that the videos that share the most last between 0 to 20 seconds even though there isn't much share. Adding the likes per video help me see that people would prefer to like content instead of sharing it.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr, lib.loc = "/opt/conda/lib/R/library")
total_trends <- read_csv("total_trends.csv")
legend_title <- "OMG My Title"
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
total_trends%>%
  ggplot(aes(video_duration, stats_shareCount, color=authorStats_heart))+geom_jitter()+
  ggtitle("Correlation between video duration and share count by their amount of likes")+xlab("Video duration")+ylab("Share count")+scale_colour_continuous(name = "Likes per video")
total_trends%>%
filter(video_duration<20)%>%
  ggplot(aes(video_duration, stats_shareCount, color=authorStats_heart))+geom_jitter()+
  ggtitle("Correlation between video duration and share count by their amount of likes <20")+xlab("Video duration")+ylab("Share count")+scale_colour_continuous(name = "Likes per video")
total_trends%>%
filter(video_duration>20)%>%
  ggplot(aes(video_duration, stats_shareCount, color=authorStats_heart))+geom_jitter()+
  ggtitle("Correlation between video duration and share count by their amount of likes >20")+xlab("Video duration")+ylab("Share count")+scale_colour_continuous(name = "Likes per video")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
